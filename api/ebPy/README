Test implementation for a Python binding for Etherbone via SWIG
Status: Work in progress, currently minimal implementation of Etherbone features (connect/disconnect/read word/write word)

Tested with both python2.7 and python3.6m. Adjust settings in Makefile accordingly
Run very simple example: python ebtest.py
Reads first word of LM32 RAM on a PexariaV and prints the value
